Hello guys, I am bubun.
Today i am here with a simple Bing image gallery script. which works fully automaticly.
All you need to do, just download the ptoject and upload it to your server. 
And also need to set a cron job to run /import.php once in each day to automaticly import images from bing.
And done.

NOTE: This project is under development now. I am adding more features to this script. If you have any suggestions, having any issues, or anything related to this project. Please do comment. Thank you :)
